# developer-machine-setup
My recommended developer machine setup for a new mac
*Generally, I prefer to use a free/open-source software if there's one available.*

## Recommended apps
- Browser - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Clipboard Manager - [Maccy](https://maccy.app/)
- Multi monitor control. Easily move windows between monitors. - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)
- Snapping tool (Images/Vider) [Monosnap](https://monosnap.com/download/mac)
- Another Video recording tool. This is allow you to narrate what you're showing. Using this for async work with my team for a bit more complex stuff than just a simple short video. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/)
- Code editor - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## Now you can use your terminal to setup other stuff easier without UI
- brew package manager for mac, just type this in your terminal  `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- iTerm `brew install --cask iterm2`
- zshell `brew install zsh`
- oh-my-zsh `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
- git `brew install git`
- gnupg to sign your git commits `brew install gnupg`
